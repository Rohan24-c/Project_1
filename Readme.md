# 🛍️ Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

## 👋 Overview
This project is all about digging into retail data to understand how a business is really performing. I focused on uncovering which products are profitable, which ones are slowing things down, and what trends appear over time (like seasonal demand). 

The idea was to turn raw sales data into actionable insights that a business could actually use to improve profits and manage inventory better.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- **SQL (SQLite):** For cleaning data and analyzing profit margins  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib):** For deeper analysis and visualizations  
- **PNG Charts / Tableau:** To visualize key patterns and trends  
- **Jupyter Notebook + VS Code:** For scripting and development
